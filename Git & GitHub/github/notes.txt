GitHub --> web based git repository hosting service.
repository -->storage place for the repository. it can be   
              folreds,files, documents,images,audios,videos. 
            * seperate repository for the each project.

git 1) only repository
gitHub  1)  repository 2) project

1) create your github account on github official website.
2) username & passwors ,mail save  in your nates.
3) create a project 
4) create a repository --  repository name, public,private,description
                           ReadMe.md  --add this file ( project, setup details ) 
                            can clone the  repository code to local local folred.
                            can dowload the repository as a .zip file.
                            can push branches to the remote repository.

by default you are on the master baranch--  can add new files to branch 
                                        -- commit changes (saving)
                                        
** connecting local and remore repositeries.
 git push --set-upstream REMOTE_REPOSITORY_URL LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME(current branch u want to push).
 EX.
    git push --set-upstream https://github.com/sadikpasha06/sadik.git branch1 

     --> this step(--set-upstream) needs only one.

     --> next time  you can  simply use origin.
  the above is used to push the local  repositeries to remote. 

  git push origin --delete BRANCH_NAME  --> delets remote branch. 


  ** having project in remote. want to wark on local.(getting project)  
   1) create  new folder in the local statem.
   2) open the foledr in the command promt(type cmd on the folder path or go terminal cd desktop,cd/desktop/cd foldername) 
   3) git clone REMOTE_REPOSITORY_URL --> copy it from github.
        the project is downloads  in your local foledr.

   4) open the local foledr with IDE(vc code,eclips,sts,intellij Idea).
   5) make changes to the  project as required. 
   6) to do any task related to git/github  must the folder opened in the cmd/terminal. otherwise can not performs.


** fork ** 
 copying the repository. (mostly used when u not allowed to push/pull the repository(restricted))
 so you  can  fork the repository to your github. and can work on it.
 

 **pull(merge)  request 
 u can request for the pull(merge) to the main branch. only the authorised can approve(merge).

--> commit the changes 
       -- git commit -m "Initial commit"           --> <commit message> 
--> link local repository with remote repository
      -- git remote add origin <repository-URL>      --> < remote(github) repository url>
--> push your changes to github 
     --      git push -u origin master               --> change master  to your working  btanch if you are not on
